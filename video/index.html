            <p class="work-text">
                Cafe Bazaar is the most popular smartphone application marketplace in Persian-speaking countries with over 40 million users.<br/>
                This case study will mainly focus on how we identified ways to make the user experience more pleasant for the average user of Bazaar's Video service.

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p class="work-text">
                    Since I was the only designer working on this project, I had to work closely with the respective Product Managers to create the best experience for our users based on business needs.<br/>
                    As part of the design process, I first benchmarked different video streaming services (such as Netflix, Peacock, etc) to understand how we can improve on the current design.<br/>
                    Then we planned the project to be done in multiple phases during all of which I had to work with two Product Managers, Backend, Mobile and Web Developers and the QA Team.<br/>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p class="work-text">
                    The video service is a new addition to Bazaar's platform, so the design of its components had not yet been customized for videos. Because of the short time-to-market, the components were taken from Apps and Games services, so I had to design new ones.<br/>
                    Here is how the Video service looked before it was redesigned:

                <h2>Benchmarking</h2>
                <p class="work-text-normal">
                    Initially, I benchmarked streaming services, and the first thing I understood was the importance of using large posters for movies and videos. I then noticed the impact the "Continue Watching" component could have on watch-time. The progress bar would make users to select on it and finish a video.

                    The design was done specifically for videos with alignment to our design system. Here are some of the iteration I made based on the benchmarking:

                    Since it can promote more than one video at the top, we chose this version. In addition, the continue watching component could cover the screen if the user only had one in that section.

                <p class="work-text-normal">
                    After the benchmarking, I found that people tend to remember movies and television shows by their posters rather than by their subheadings.<br/>
                    Additionally, by doing that, we decreased the cognitive load on users' minds by not showing so many posters simultaneously on each screen.

                    Comparing the new and old players, the new one is easier to use since the user can easily figure out what options we offer and select the right one.<br/>
                    For instance, the title of the video has been added so that users can easily identify the content. Also you can now choose a series episode within the player or skip directly to the next one.

                    In addition to improving Video's consistency with other services, we can also expect to see watch-times increase as a result of the new design.<br/>
                    Following the implementation of recommendations at the end of videos, engaging users watched 1 more video than before and 17 minutes more videos per day.

                    The positive outcome has given us more motivation to explore what would make users more engaged, so we are going to show the progress of the watched video on its detail page, and if they have watched fully, a checkmark will be shown to them. Hopefully, this mini gamification will encourage them to come back and finish the video they began watching.
