        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="work-text">
            The chat module was released in August for the latest version of Snapp and 39% of users updated on the first
            release and had the feature. It enables passengers to chat directly with drivers. In the design, as shown
            below, I have placed it beside the Call button. The reason behind it was that both of them are for
            contacting the driver so they should be next to each other.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p class="work-text">After rolling out the feature, the analysis showed that the usage of chat in the
                Passenger app was about 4%. While on the Driver side it was 8%. It was evident that drivers are using
                chat more than passengers, and passengers may not even notice the messages, let alone reply.

            <h2>Survey Result</h2>
            <p class="work-text-normal">A survey was run to see how satisfied the passengers and drivers were about this
                feature. The result showed that the problem wasn’t the design and we had to find the bottleneck.

            <h2>Predefined Messages</h2>
            <p class="work-text-normal">Another problem we had, was the low usage of the predefined messages. It seemed
                that Driver’s predefined messages are more effective than Passenger’s since they preferred to type the
                messages themselves.

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="work-text-normal">
                We had a session with the respective PM and decided to run a survey to find the reason why passengers
                are not using Chat as much as we expected. We also agreed to increase awareness by running marketing
                campaigns. <br/>
                <br/>
                For the survey, first I gathered all of our hypotheses for the low usage of this feature. Then I chose
                two segments of our users based on whether Chat was available for them and if they have used Chat or
                not. For each segment, 40 users were asked to take part in answering a questionnaire. Users were
                segmented based on the following criteria:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Those who normally take more than 20 rides per month and Chat was enabled for them and they have
                        used
                        it for at least 1 time. <br/><br/>
                    </li>

                    <li> Those who normally take more than 20 rides per month and Chat was enabled for them and they
                        never
                        used
                        it.
                        <br/> <br/>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Lastly, I made two questionnaires and handed them off to our Call Center (CC) team so they can start
                calling those users and ask them the questions.

                <li> Some of the eligible users use to call the driver for telling the right location or don’t cancel
